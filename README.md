#### Jam, A new way of learning how to build applications!

#### General information
You've joined the 4-week learning process to become a pretty good Reactive Programming developer.

During these 4 weeks, you will be challenged on these different topics:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Reactive Programming concepts like Observable, Operators and schedulers...
- RxJS
- RxJS Marble
  
We will be building a few applications along the way. If you are at ease using library like RxJS, these challenges
should be easy for you but you'll still be able to learn the inner workings of such technologies. If you're a beginner
in Reactive Programming, you're in luck, these sessions (challenge + demo day) will be a great way for you to become proficient at using libraries like RxJS.


It is important to read the instructions before starting any exercise. The instructions could be found here [`instructions`](./instructions)


#### How to get started with this challenge?

First you need to install all dependencies with either of these commands: `yarn` or `npm install`.


##### Instructions
All exercises instructions are under the folder [`instructions`](./instructions).

> Did you install all dependencies? If no, please run either of these commands: `yarn` or `npm install` 

#### How does it work?
If you're here then you've already cloned this repository. This is a great first step. Well done!

After cloning the repository, you can tackle each challenge as instructed in the [`instructions`](./instructions) folder.
Once all the tests are green, and you're satisfied with the quality of your code you can `commit` and `push` your current version. 

If you're not familiar with git, here is the procedure:
- First `add` your modifications you've made with the command `git add src` (type this command at the project root folder)
- Then `commit` the modification with the command `git commit -m "What did you do?!"`
- Finally `push` the code using the command `git push origin` 

Once we've received your code we will check it and if all is good we will provide you with the next challenge. To check your progress go to https://app.jams.dev. We will update that page with your progress as soon as you push your code. Then we will provide you with the commands to start the next challenge if there are any left.

If you're stuck somewhere, do not hesitate to go on https://jams.dev and ask for help using the chat or send an email to 007@jams.dev

#### By the end of this first session, you will be able to strengthen your understanding of the following concepts:
- Build your own observables from scratch
- Learn basic testing mechanisms (Not the best practises for now but check back on the second challenge) 
- Inner working of the design pattern observable/observer


> Did you install all dependencies? If no, please run either of these commands: `yarn` or `npm install` 


#### FAQ
**1 - Is this a paid course or challenge?**
No, this is not a paid course. However, if you would like to help us in our journey to building this learning platform, your support will go a long way and It will be appreciated. 

**2 - Can I invite my friends or colleagues?**
Yes, we welcome your entire company and colleagues.

**3 - Where can I find the next steps?**
After each session, we will host a demo (office hours) then publish the new challenge on Monday at 10 AM. If you sign up on our platform, you will receive an invite once the challenge is ready for you to start. 

**4 - How long can I take to finish each challenge?**
Challenges run from Monday to Friday each week. But you can continue working on them beyond that timeframe.
  
**5 - My company is interested in organising a training in Reactive Programming, can you help us?**
For sure, we've helped hundred of companies in their adoption of these ways of writing code. Reach out to use via the chat or email: 007@hackages.io for inquiries

**6 - Will you record the office hours?**
Yes, we will. However, you'll get more value by joining them live. You can ask your own questions.


*Hope you'll enjoy this innovative way of learning!*
